Online Store 🖥️

This project is an online computer store with a primary focus on the backend. The frontend is designed, but currently, the main emphasis is on server functionality and business logic.

Project Status 🚧

The project is still under development, and features are being added gradually.

The goal is to add new parts daily and upload them to GitHub.

The backend is fully developed by me, while AI assistance is used for some frontend parts to speed up the design process.

Key Features 💻

Product and inventory management 

Order registration and user management

Basic responsive frontend interface

AI-assisted generation of some frontend components

Note ⚠️

This project is still in progress and is uploaded to GitHub for testing and tracking development. Updates and changes are regularly pushed to the repository.

Daily Workflow 📅

After each significant change or daily:

Add changes to Git (git add .)

Commit changes (git commit -m "Update: description of changes")

Push changes to GitHub (git push)

This ensures that both project progress and my activity are tracked on GitHub.
